# DeadlockFreeMC
Minecraft concurrency utility to await CompletableFuture's using a synchronous executor. (Java 8 compatible)

## Archived

The functionality of DeadlockFreeMC has been integrated into [ArimAPI](https://github.com/A248/ArimAPI) which requires Java 11.

I will not be maintaining two versions of this utility for separate JDK versions. DeadlockFreeMC has known bugs fixed in the aforementioned, updated replacement.
