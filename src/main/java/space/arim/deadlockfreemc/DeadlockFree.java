/**
 * Provides the ability to await completion of futures using synchronous executors on the main thread
 * <i>without</i> dead-locking the main thread. <br>
 * Before this, the following would cause a deadlock if {@code join} is called from the main thread.: <br>
 * <br>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Executor synchronousExecutor = (cmd) -> Bukkit.getScheduler().runTask(plugin, cmd);
 * CompletableFuture<?> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> doSomethingOnMainThread(), synchronousExecutor);
 * future.join();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * The main thread will wait on {@code join}, but the future will never complete,
 * because, in order to complete, the main thread must also run the scheduler tasks. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Solution</b> <br>
 * Instead, use this interface, first getting an instance via {@link #getInstance()}. Create a {@code Future}/{@code CompletableFuture}
 * as usual. The future must use this {@code Executor} if running synchronously and NOT the platform-specific scheduler.
 * Then, use {@link #join(CompletableFuture)} instead of <code>future.join()</code>. <br>
 * <br>
 * The example code thus becomes: <br>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * DeadlockFree deadlockFreeExecutor = DeadlockFree.get();
 * CompletableFuture<?> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> doSomethingOnMainThread(), deadlockFreeExecutor);
 * deadlockFreeExecutor.join(future);
 * }
 * </pre>
